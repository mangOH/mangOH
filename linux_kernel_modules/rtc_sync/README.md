RTC-SYNC KERNEL MODULE
==========================

The rtc_hctosys function was taken from this page: https://github.com/spotify/linux/blob/master/drivers/rtc/hctosys.c

The systohc function was modified from Linux source code 'drivers/rtc/systohc.c' to fit 32-bit system

The rest of the functions were written by Sierra Wireless
